Creating a new file and pushing to remote repository
Create a new file in the Git directory by typing the following command from either the Bash or Windows command line. The following command will open and create a file called example.txt in Notepad. In Git Bash, you could also use the touch command to create a blank new file and then type "start <name of file>" to open the file in your favorite text editor.
start notepad example.txt
In the text editor, enter some text into the file and save and exit the file.
Back at the command line type the following command to get the current status of your branch and untracked files.
git status
Git will display a window similar to the example shown below, showing that the file we created is new and untracked by Git.
